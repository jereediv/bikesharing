# Bikesharing

## Project overview:
Our client, Kate wants to put together a pitch to convince investors that the Citibike business model can be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. Using data from the successful operation in New York, we will put together data visualizations using Tableau to help investors understand the data trends.

## Results:
We want to use our visualizations to answer the questions of potential investors. For example, when are people checking out bikes?

## Summary:
Tableau has allowed us to visualize a large set of data to help decide how to approach bikesharing in Des Moines. Investors should be able to make informed decisions based on our visualizations.
